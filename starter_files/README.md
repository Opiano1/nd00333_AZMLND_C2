# Operationalizing Machine Learning

Microsoft provides a cloud based solution with a Machine Learning component (Azure ML service) that provides the capacity to train, develop and deploy a Machine Learning mode into product. This project used <a href='https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv'>Bank Marketing dataset</a> to train a machine learning algorithm with AutoML, deploy it and consume. In another stage, a pipeline was created, published and consumed. The approach followed in this project is as shown below;

* Authentication
* Automated ML Experiment
* Deploy the best model
* Enable logging
* Swagger Documentation
* Consume model endpoints
* Create and publish a pipeline
* Documentation



## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
